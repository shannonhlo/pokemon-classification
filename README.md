## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to apply simple binary classification models to a Pokemon dataset to help classify Legendary Pokemon.

### Brief

Did you ~~have a nice childhood~~ grow up in the late 90s or early 2000s? If so, you've probably heard of Pokemon. Odds are, you're familiar with popular Pokemon like Pikachu, Charizard or Mewtwo. 

Fun fact: there are currently 898 Pokemon. Of those, only 59 are labeled as being **Legendary**. Don't know what is a Legendary Pokemon? Imagine them as the "Alpha-Chad's" of the Poke-world. 

We thought it would be fun to train a machine to identify these apex type Pokemon. Said another way, what features are most significant in determining whether or not a Pokemon is Legendary?
