## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to apply simple binary classification models to a Pokemon dataset to help classify Legendary Pokemon.

### Brief

Did you ~~have a nice childhood~~ grow up in the late 90s or early 2000s? If so, you've probably heard of Pokemon like Pikachu, Charizard or Mewtwo.

Nearly a decade of Pokemon generations later and the franchise is still thriving. But this isn't a sell of Pokemon - its a data-science project! We thought it would be fun to train a machine to identify a Legendary Pokemon given information about them. Said another way, what features are most significant in determining whether or not a Pokemon was Legendary?
